## Overview 👀

Reactive-Clima is a React app that uses Open Weather and Google Maps APIs to display the five-day forecast of your favorite cities using visual graphs. You can search for any city in the world and see the temperature, pressure, and humidity trends. It's a simple and elegant way to keep track of the weather conditions wherever you are or plan to go. 🌎
